# PerceptronORGate
C++ Perceptron that learns basic logic gates (like OR) using supervised learning. Demonstrates how weights and bias are updated during training. 

# 🧠 C++ Perceptron Logic Gate Learner

A simple implementation of a single-layer perceptron in C++ that learns basic logic gates like OR using supervised learning.

## 🔍 Features

- Trains on labeled data using the Perceptron Learning Rule
- Adjusts weights and bias based on error
- Prints output for each training epoch
- Designed to demonstrate fundamental ML concepts using C++
